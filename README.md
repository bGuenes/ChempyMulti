- An early version of Chempy is presented [here](http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:16-heidok-199349).

## Installing Chempy
Chempy is completely written in python 2.7. and is working with the latest verion. Its dependencies are: numpy, matplotlib, multiprocessing and [emcee](http://dan.iel.fm/emcee/current/) (for the MCMC), and [corner](http://corner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (for the MCMC plots). They are all pip installable and you can also get part of it with [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

Chempy itself can be cloned to your computer via
```
clone https://github.com/jan-rybizki/Chempy.git
```
## Getting started
The jupyter [tutorial](https://github.com/jan-rybizki/Chempy/tree/master/tutorials) illustrates the basic usage of Chempy and can be run on your local machine or just inspected in this github repository.
